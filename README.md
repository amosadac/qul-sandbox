# QUL Sandbox
This a place to play around with Github. Here's some fun things to try:

## Git/Github

First things first! You'll need to install [Git][1]. For Windows it comes with Git Bash which can be a handle alternative to the standard Command Prompt. There is a good [lynda.com course][1a] on Git/Github.

## Atom

A really good (open-source, cross-platform) text editor is [Atom][2]. It's built by Github people. Recommended!

### Atom Packages

Atom has many community packages. Here are a couple recommended ones:

1. [atom-live-server][2a]: lets you quickly pop open a web server to preview HTML, CSS, JS, etc.
2. [pandoc-convert][2b]: once you realize how cool Markdown is, you'll want this to convert your Markdown files to .docx, etc.

It also has a bunch of core packages (i.e. you don't need to install them); a couple we'll want to use are:

1. [markdown-preview][2c]
2. [github][2d]

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is really easy to use. It's what this file is written in! Check out [this cheatsheet][3] and you can learn the basics in a few minutes. It's really fun to write Markdown in Atom because of the nice syntax highlighting and the mardown-preview package that let's you see exactly what your output will look like. From the Atom menu go `Packages > Markdown Preview > Toggle Preview`.

## Suggested Exercise

Here is a little excercise to try all of these things:

1. Clone this repository to your local computer (open a terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/qulib/qul-sandbox.git`)
2. Create `your-fun-filename.md`
3. Play around with Markdown using the cheatsheet
4. Use the github package in Atom to commit your changes
